# 🎯 Bug Bounty Skills

> **Every great bug bounty skill on GitHub. One repo. Refreshed daily.**

The `skills/` folder holds **every `.md` skill file** harvested daily from the best bug bounty, offensive security, OSINT and red team skill repositories on GitHub — flattened, deduplicated, and credited to every source author.

## 📅 How it works

A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (harvest.yml) runs **daily at 03:17 UTC**: it reads `sources.txt`, downloads every `SKILL.md` from each source repo, dedupes by content hash, and drops one flat copy in `skills/` named `<owner>-<repo>-<path>.md`. Trigger manually anytime: **Actions → Daily Skill Harvest → Run workflow**.

## ➕ Add a repository

PR one line into `sources.txt`:

```text
owner/repo
```

The next daily run picks it up.

## ⚠️ Safety

Written by third parties for **authorized** security testing only. Read any skill before installing it into an agent, and run it only against targets you have permission to test. Aggregation is not endorsement.
